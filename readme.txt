== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: What is the Facebook App ID and App Secret, and why are they required?

A: The Facebook App ID and App Secret are required by Facebook to access data via the Facebook graph API. 
To signup for a developer account or learn more see - http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/

Q: How do I find the Facebook ID of the page for which I wish to synchronize events?

A: Goto the page you're interested in - ex. https://www.facebook.com/webtrends  
Copy the URL and replace 'www' with 'graph' - ex. https://graph.facebook.com/webtrends 
The ID is the first item in the resulting text. In this example it is "54905721286".
Of course, 'webtrends' itself is accepted as a value too (it will just add an extra call to facebook to get the page ID).

Q: Do my Facebook events get updated on a schedule?

A: Yes, You can choose the update interval and also update immediately when you press the 'Update' button from the Sync FB Events section within settings.

Q: Why do I get a blank screen when running an update?

A: Check your Facebook App ID, Facebook App Secret and Facebook Page IDs. One of them is probably incorrect.
